              <p>Whilst disabling password authentication for SSH access is fairly uncontroversial, whether or not SSHing in directly as root should be allowed seems to be a topic which will split most rooms.</p>

              <p>My personal view is that as long as password authentication is disabled for SSH access, there is very little, if any, additional protection offered by disabling root access. But your milage may vary.</p>

              <p>By default when you use ssh user@yourserpip authentication will first be attempted by public key. This means looking at your private key, by default in ∼ /.ssh/id_rsa , and checking to see whether there is a matching public key in ∼ /.ssh/authorised_keys on the remote machine. If there is not, you will then be prompted to enter the password for the user you are trying to connect as.</p>
